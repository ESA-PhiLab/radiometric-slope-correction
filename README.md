This repository holds the supplementary material for the article of Vollrath, Mullissa 
and Reiche 2020: "Angular-based radiometric slope correction for 
Sentinel-1 on Google Earth Engine" that can be found 
[here](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/11/1867). 

Within the javascript folder, the code holds the routine and an example script 
for its application. 

The notebooks can be used to reproduce the results presented within the article
and provide a python based implementation of the routine.
